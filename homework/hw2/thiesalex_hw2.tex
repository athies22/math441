		Prove or give a counterexample: if $U_{1}$, $U_{2}$, $W$ are subspaces of $V$ such that $$V = U_{1} \oplus W \ \ \text{and} \ \ V = U_{2} \oplus W$$ then $U_{1} = U_{2}$.

		\begin{enumerate}[\hspace*{5mm} (a)]
		\item Show that if we think of $\C$ as a vector space over $\R$, then the list $(1 + i, 1 - i)$ is linearly independent.
		\item Show that if we think of $\C$ as a vector space over $\C$, then the list $(1 + i, 1 - i)$ is linearly dependent.

		\subsection*{Problem 6}	
		Suppose $v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}, v_{4}$ is linearly independent in $V$. 
		Prove that the list $$v_{1} - 􏰋v_{2}, v_{2} - 􏰋v_{3}, v_{3} - 􏰋v_{4}, v_{4}$$ is also linearly independent.

		\subsection*{Problem 9}
		Prove or give a counterexample: If $v_{1}, \dots, v_{m}$ and $w_{1}, \dots, w_{m}$ are linearly independent lists of vectors in $V$, then $v_{1} + w_{1}, \dots, v_{m} + w_{m}$ is linearly independent.
