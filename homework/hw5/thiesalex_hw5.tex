	\section*{Section 3.B}
		\subsection*{Problem 6}
		Prove that there does not exist a linear map $T : \R^{5} \to \R^{5}$ such that $$\range T = \null T.$$

		\begin{proof}
		\end{proof}
		% subsection problem_6 (end)

		\subsection*{Problem 16}
		Suppose there exists a linear map on $V$ whose null space and range are both finite-dimensional. 
		Prove that $V$ is finite-dimensional.

		\begin{proof}
		\end{proof}
		% subsection problem_16 (end)

		\subsection*{Problem 21}
		Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $T \in \Ell(V,W)$. 
		Prove that $T$ is surjective if and only if there exists $S \in \Ell(V,W)$ such that $TS$ is the identity map on $W$.

		\begin{proof}
		\end{proof}

	% section section_3_b (end)

	\section*{Section 3.C}
		\subsection*{Problem 4}
		Suppose $v_{1}, \dots, v_{m}$ is a basis of $V$ and $W$ is finite-dimensional. 
		Suppose $T \in \Ell(V,W)$. 
		Prove that there exists a basis $w_{1}, \dots, w_{m}$ of $W$ such that all the entries in the first column of $\mathcal{M}(T)$ (with respect to the bases $v_{1}, \dots, v_{m}$ and $w_{1}, \dots, w_{m}$) are 0 except for possibly a 1 in the first row, first column.

		\begin{proof}
		\end{proof}
		% subsection problem_4 (end)

		\subsection*{Problem 10}
		Suppose $A$ is an $m$-by-$n$ matrix and $C$ is an $n$-by-$p$ matrix. 
		Prove that $$(AC)_{j,\cdot}$$
		In other words, show that row $j$ of $AC$ equals (row $j$ of $A$) times $C$.

		\begin{proof}
		\end{proof}
		% subsection problem_10 (end)

		\subsection*{Problem 14}
		Prove that matrix multiplication is associative. 
		In other words, suppose $A$, $B$, and $C$ are matrices whose sizes are such that $(AB)C$ makes sense. Prove that $A(BC)$ makes sense and that $(AB)C = A(BC)$.
