		\subsection*{Exercise 7}
		Suppose $v, x$ are vectors in $V$ and $U, W$ are subspaces of $V$ such that $v + U = x + W$. 
		Prove that $U = W$.

		\begin{proof}
		Let $v, x, V, U, W$ be as above.
		Then $v = x + w_{1}$ for some $w_{1} \in W$, and by Theorem 3.85 we have $v - x \in W$.
		Thus, for some $u \in U$ it follows that $v + u = x + w_{2}$ for some $w_{2} \in W$.
		Therefore, we have that $u = (x-v) + w_{2} = -(v-x) + w_{2} = -w_{1}+w_{2} \in W$.
		Since $u$ was chosen arbitrarily, we have shown that $U \subseteq W$, \textit{mutatis mutandis} to show that $W \subseteq U$.
		Hence, by double-inclusion we have shown that $U = W$, as we aimed to do.
		\end{proof}
		% subsection exercise_7 (end)

		\subsection*{Exercise 13}
		Suppose $U$ is a subspace of $V$ and $v_{1} + U, \dots, v_{m} + U$ is a basis of $V/U$ and $u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}$ is a basis of $U$. 
		Prove that $v_{1}, \dots, v_{m}, \dots, u_{n}$ is a basis of $V$.

		\begin{proof}
		Let $U, V, v_{1} + U, \dots, v_{m} + U$, and $u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}$ be as above.
		Notice that since $v_{1} + U, \dots, v_{m} + U$ and $u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}$ are bases, they are linearly independent by themselves, and $v_{1}, \dots, v_{m}, u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}$ is linearly independent in $V$.
		Additionally, these bases tell us that $\dim V/U = m$ and $\dim U = n$.
		By Theorem 3.89 we know that $$\dim V = \dim V/U + \dim U,$$ if $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space and $U \subseteq V$ is a subspace.
		Notice that $\dim[v_{1}, \dots, v_{m}, u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}] = m+n$, so $v_{1}, \dots, v_{m}, \dots, u_{n}$ is a linearly independent list of the appropriate length to be a basis of $V$, if $V$ is finite-dimensional.
		Therefore, to show that $v_{1}, \dots, v_{m}, u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}$ is a basis of $V$, it will suffice to show that $V$ is finite-dimensional.
		\end{proof}
		% subsection exercise_13 (end)

		\subsection*{Exercise 16}
		Suppose $U$ is a subspace of $V$ such that $\dim V/U = 1$. 
		Prove that there exists $\ph \in \Ell(V, \F)$ such that $\null \ph = U$.

		\begin{proof}
		Let $U,V$ be as above.
		The fact that $\dim V/U = 1$ tells us that there exists a $v \in V$ such that $v \notin U$ and such that $v + U$ is a basis of $V/U$.
		We can send scalar multiples of $v$ to themselves in $\F$, i.e. define the linear map $\psi : V/U \to \F$ by the mapping $\lambda v + U \mapsto \lambda$, clearly $\psi \in \Ell(V/U,\F)$.
		Next, we can use the quotient map to send things from $V$ to $V/U$, if we compose these two functions we'll have $\ph(\lambda v) = (\psi \circ \pi)(\lambda v) = \lambda$.
		More formally, define $\ph : V \to V/U \to \F$ by the mapping $\lambda v \mapsto \lambda v + U \mapsto \lambda$.

	\section*{Section 4}
		\subsection*{Exercise 4}
		Suppose $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $m \leq n$, and suppose $\lambda_{1}, \dots, \lambda_{m} \in \F$Ùè∞É. 
		Prove that there exists a polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}(\F)$ with $\deg p = n$ such that $0 = p(\lambda_{1}) = \dots = p(\lambda_{m})$ and such that $p$ has no other zeros.

		\begin{proof}
		Let $m,n$ be as above.
		Define $p(z) = (z - \lambda_{1}) \cdots (z - \lambda_{m})$ for $\lambda_{1}, \dots, \lambda_{m} \in \F$; notice $p \in \mathcal{P}(\F)$.
		Then $p$ has $\lambda_{1}, \dots, \lambda_{m}$ as roots, but we can see that $\deg p = m$, which is too small.
		Let $q = n-m+1$, then modify $p$ so that $\tilde{p}(z) = (z - \lambda_{1})^{q} \cdots (z - \lambda_{m})$.
		Then we still have exactly $\lambda_{1}, \dots, \lambda_{m}$ as roots, and with $m-1$ linear factors each with multiplicity 1, and 1 linear factor with multiplicity $q = n-m+1$, it follows that $\deg \tilde{p} = n$.
		Hence, we have shown that here exists a polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}(\F)$ with $\deg p = n$ such that $0 = p(\lambda_{1}) = \dots = p(\lambda_{m})$ and such that $p$ has no other zeros, as we aimed to do.
		\end{proof}
		% subsection exercise_4 (end)

		\subsection*{Exercise 5}
		Suppose $m$ is a nonnegative integer, $z_{1}, \dots, z_{m+1}$ are distinct elements of $\F$, and $w_{1}, \dots, w_{m+1} \in \F$.
		Prove that there exists a unique polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}_{m}(\F)$ such that $$p(z_{j}) = w_{j}$$ for $j = 1, \dots, m+1$.

		\begin{proof}
		Let $m, z_{1}, \dots, z_{m+1}$, and $w_{1}, \dots, w_{m+1}$ be as above.
		Define $T : \mathcal{P}_{m}(\F) \to \F^{m+1}$ by the mapping $Tp \mapsto (p(z_{1}), \dots, p(z_{m+1})) = (w_{1}, \dots, w_{m+1})$.
		We will prove existence and uniqueness by showing that $T$ is a bijection, but first we have to show that $T$ is a linear map.
		To show that $T$ is a linear map we will show that it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
		Let $q,r \in \mathcal{P}_{m}(\F)$.
		Then, $T(q+r) = ((q+r)(z_{1}), \dots, (q+r)(z_{m+1}))$, since $(q+r) \in \mathcal{P}_{m}(\F)$, it follows that $T$ is closed under addition.
		Let $\lambda \in \F$.
		Then, $T(\lambda q) = (\lambda q(z_{1}), \dots, \lambda q(z_{m+1})) = \lambda (q(z_{1}), \dots, q(z_{m+1}))$, so we have that $T$ is closed under scalar multiplication, hence $T \in \Ell(\mathcal{P}_{m}(\F), \F^{m+1})$; it remains to show that $T$ is a bijection.

		\textbf{Injective}.
		Let $s \in \null T$, then $s(z_{1}) = \cdots = s(z_{m+1})) = 0$, which implies that $s$ is a degree 4 polynomial that somehow has $m+1$ distinct roots.
		This contradiction tells us that $s = 0$, therefore $T$ is injective.

		\textbf{Surjective}.
		By the FTLM we have,
		\begin{align*}
			\dim \range T &= \dim \mathcal{P}_{m}(\F) - \dim \null T, \\
			&= m + 1 - 0, \\
			&= \dim \F^{m+1}. \\
			&\Ra \, \text{$T$ is surjective}.
		\end{align*}
		Hence, $T$ is both injective, and surjective, therefore it is a bijection as we aimed to show.
